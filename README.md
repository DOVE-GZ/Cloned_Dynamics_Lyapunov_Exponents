# Cloned_Dynamics_Lyapunov_Exponents


## (Under construction)

### Descrition

This repository contains scripts developed using MATLAB and C languages which are used to implement the Cloned Dynamics methodology. This approach aims to compute the Lyapunov exponents associate to nonlinear dynamical systems, specially the ones with some kind of non-smothness.
